# Operating Systems
## Desktop Linux Distros

But, life isn't perfect. Sometimes we have to use Windows.  
We cannot get rid of every possible problems with Windows, but we can make it better. 

# Networking
## Router Firmaware
### [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/)
Put Linux on your old router and make it free and open!  
OpenWrt works better than the stock firmware from their vendor. It offers better stability and more features, such as VPN, DDNS and DNS over HTTPS.

# Surfing on the Web
## Desktop Web Browsers
These are the Web Browsers I tried and used personally.  
For a more detailed comparison, please refer to [PrivacyTests.org](https://privacytests.org/).

### ~~[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)~~
I can't recommend Firefox anymore. Mozilla have been disappointing us again and again, they have approved that revenue is their first priority.  
This is my breaking point as [Firefox now collects user data by default](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40974112).  
Feb 2025 update: [Chat, Is Mozilla Firefox Cooked - by Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3Yvv4EaTfs)

### [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)
A custom and independent fork of Firefox, with the primary goals of privacy, security and user freedom.  
No telemetry, no tracking. Lots of privacy setting applied by default. Daily right now, highly recommend.

### [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/)
Another fork of Firefox, it's faster, and built without all the telemetry. Tracking protection is enabled by default.  
Is also offers Oblivious DNS as the DNS-over-HTTPS. It also comes with their own themes that look like the classic Firefox.

### [Floorp](https://floorp.app/en)
Floorp is an independent Firefox fork, build by hobbyist Japanese students.  
Beside all the Strong Tracking Protection and No User Tracking, Floorp really shines with its Sidebars, Flexible Toolbar and Tab Bar.  
[Floorp's comparison with Waterfox by their developer](https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/Floorp/issues/100#issuecomment-1272325327)

### [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/)
Zen was inspired by [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) but based on Firefox.  
As Arc slowly ceased development, Zen became the beautifully designed and privacy-focused broswer that a lot of developer use.

### [Brave](https://brave.com/)
The zero configuration needed browser with Ad blocker build in.  
Apart from all the Web3 feature, it's a solid browser for someone that don't really want to mess with their browser. 

### [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)
Vanilla Chromium but without all Google dependency. 

## Search Engines

### Duckduckgo Lite / HTML

They were aiming for beating WhatsApp and fight for user privacy.  
Super user-friendly and only require phone number to sign up.  
Note: *Signal's server is not open source, but the client is.*
